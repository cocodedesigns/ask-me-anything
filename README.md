# ask-me-anything
Ask Me Anything WordPress Plugin

This is a WordPress plugin which allows you to create simple modal window forms that collect question data from your users. The QA style feedback can be either private or posted to the site as a public thread. The form questions and styles are highly configurable.
Simply install the plugin and away you go!

There is an older version of this plugin at https://wordpress.org/plugins/answer-my-question/ which is no longer supported. Pull requests welcome.
